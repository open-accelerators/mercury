  Party Lifecycle Management

  This service domain tracks the state of a party relationship with the bank from the initial checks made during the establishment of a new party connection and subsequently maintained as necessary over the duration of the relationship. The checks and the maintenance requirements will vary by party type and jurisdiction. The checks cover bank specific and legal and regulatory considerations and may be updated based on a standard schedule or by request in specific circumstances.
